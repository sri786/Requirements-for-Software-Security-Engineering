Pi-hole Threat Model
====================

R3tr0 evaluated the open source software Pi-hole utilizing the Microsoft Threat modeling tool 2016 and the previous [misuse cases](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/03df13bf-2fe3-4b3c-a4bb-1493b038bd23) which allowed the group to identify the threat model against the Pi-hole process. Retr0 developed a level 1 DFD which supports all threats identified within the previous misuse cases within Lucid Chart located [here.](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/03df13bf-2fe3-4b3c-a4bb-1493b038bd23)

R3tr0 analyzed this diagram and by utilizing the STRIDE model we have identified the following threats as outlined below. 

Spoofing
--------

**1.** Spoofing of Source Data Store Blacklist

Tampering
---------

**11.** The DNS log Data Store Could Be Corrupted 

Category:	Tampering

Description:	Data flowing across DNS Query may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to corruption of DNS log. Ensure the integrity of the data flow to the data store.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**18.** Potential Lack of Input Validation for Pi-hole  

Category:	Tampering

Description:	Data flowing across Input Data Flow may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Pi-hole or an elevation of privilege attack against Pi-hole or an information disclosure by Pi-hole. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.

Repudiation
-----------

**3.** External Entity Network Traffic Result Potentially Denies Receiving Data 

Category:	Repudiation

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**33.** External Entity Network Traffic Result Potentially Denies Receiving Data  

Category:	Repudiation

Description:	Network Traffic Result claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

Information Disclosure
-----------------------

**2.** Weak Access Control for a Resource  

Category:	Information Disclosure

Description:	Improper data protection of Blacklist can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**20.** Data Flow Sniffing  

Category:	Information Disclosure

Description:	Data flowing across Input Data Flow may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**26.** Weak Access Control for a Resource  

Category:	Information Disclosure

Description:	Improper data protection of DNS log can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**32.** Weak Access Control for a Resource  

Category:	Information Disclosure

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**6.** Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Pi-hole or Blacklist  

Category:	Denial Of Service

Description:	Does Pi-hole or Blacklist take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

Category:	Denial Of Service

Description:	Does Pi-hole or Whitelist  take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.

Justification:	<no mitigation provided>

**25.** Cross Site Request Forgery 

Category:	Elevation Of Privilege

Description:	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.</td></tr><tr><td id="threat-title-justification" role="rowheader" tabindex="0"><strong>Justification:</strong></td><td class="infotd" tabindex="0" role="gridcell" headers="threat-title-justification">&lt;no mitigation provided&gt;</td></tr></table></div><br /><h3 tabindex="0">
